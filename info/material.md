# Hoplite (Ancient Greece)

avg height human today: 170 cm (male), 158 cm (female)
avg height 162 cm (male), 153 cm (female)
avg weigth 63 kg (male), 53 kg (female)

The principal weapons of a hoplite infantryman were a long ash wood spear (doru) and a short sword (xiphos).
The spear measured on average 2.5 metres (8 ft.) in length and was fitted with a bronze or iron blade and
a four-sided end spike (sauroter). The sword was also of iron with a straight or sometimes curved blade
(machaira or kopis) no more than 60 cm (2 ft) in length. No doubt many hoplites also carried a dagger (encheiridion)
as extra insurance. Protection was provided by a leather-lined bronze helmet which could vary in design, was
often crested, and protected the head, neck, and face. A corselet or breastplate (thorax) of bronze or
leather (later reduced to a laminated linen vest to save weight - a linothorax), bronze greaves (knemides)
to protect the shins, and sometimes arm-guards were also worn.
The hoplite carried a large circular shield (hoplon or aspis) some 80 cm (2.5 ft.) in diameter and weighing
as much as 8 kg. This was made of wood or stiff leather, faced with bronze, and was held with the left arm
placed through a central band (porpax) and gripped via a strap (antilabe) attached to the shield rim.

# A few words about bronze from discussion: 
http://myarmoury.com/talk/viewtopic.31591.html:
...Iron is harder than soft bronzes, but hard high tin bronzes (such as were used to make cutting weapons)
are harder than iron. Work-hardened iron can be harder than annealed high tin bronzes, but
work-hardened high tin bronzes are harder still.

For bronze vs iron weapons, bronze will be harder. But bronze weapons need to be a little thicker
to have the same stiffness, since bronze has a lower elastic modulus, and bronze is denser, so bronze
weapons will be heavier, on average, for the same length and similar geometry.

High-tin bronze that is hammer-hardened is *harder* than any iron or steel available in the ancient world.
It isn't until quenching of high-carbon steels becomes common that steel is overall superior to bronze.
Mind you, straight hardness is only one of many qualities that must be compared when considering
what makes weapons or armor "better"!

##Combat techniques

Analysis of battle damage to weapons from the massive Roman Iron Age deposit of Nydham indicated 
the primary use for the large round shields was in fending off missiles, while sword duels were 
conducted blade on blade (Schloß Gottorf: Archäologische Landesmuseum der Christian-Albrechts 
Universität, Schleswig Germany: pers. obs. 1994). However, the use of shields in hand to hand 
combat is recorded in customs such as the holmgang duel. The heavy iron construction of the Viking 
Age boss is unlike the Roman Iron Age examples of thin bronze, perhaps indicating a change to a 
hand-to-hand fighting style in which parrys with the boss were possible. The thin boards would 
split easily, and could perhaps have been deliberately made so, in order to snare an attacker's 
blade.

* [Thickness Measures](shield-thickness.jpg)


Small clamps made of iron or bronze sheet are occasionally found in graves (Table 3; Fig. 5). 
Clamps were sometimes simply decorated by tinning, punching or engraving (Fig. 5-c). In Birka graves Bj 
628 and 736 the clamps were butted to produce a continuous edge (Fig. 6), however, only sections of 
the rim survive, perhaps indicating deliberate damage before burial.

# [Flax](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/flax-fiber#:~:text=Flax%20is%20stronger%20than%20cotton,from%20flax%20is%20called%20linen.)

Flax fibre comes under the category of bast fibre (Fig. 3.1) and is extracted from the plant of the 
linseed/flax plant (Linum usitatissimum L.). This plant is popular for two reason: one is flax fibre 
and another is linseed oil (used for industrial applications) extracted from the seed of the plant 
(Basu and Dutta, 2014). According to historical records, the earliest example of preserved linen 
appears to be a needle-netted linen headpiece from Nahal Hemar Cave in Israel 8500 years ago, and 
Swiss Lake Dwellers used a native flax to make cloth 5000–6000 years ago. It was also found that 
ancient Egyptians used clothing, bed linen, and shrouds for mummies and for ships’ sails prepared 
mainly from linen in those days. The earliest Egyptian linen cloth dates from the Old Kingdom, but 
flax appears to be have been grown for linen about 5000 years ago in the Early Dynastic period 
(Debnath, 2016). Sharma et al. (1999) described and compared different retting methods of flax 
fibre, including water, dew and enzyme-retted, on physical chemical and thermal properties of flax
fibre. 

Linen is a “stiff” fabric and is less likely to cling to the skin; when it billows away, it quickly 
dries out and becomes cool again. Summer clothes made of linen possess high air permeability, 
which allows air to flow through the fabric easily and allows the body to breathe.

The main benefit of wearing linen clothes in hot weather is the coolness they provide. Thanks 
to the weave and linen fiber specifics linen fabric allow more airflow and its structure means 
it stays away from your skin allowing better airflow over your body. Linen is a “stiff” fabric 
and is less likely to cling to the skin; when it billows away, it quickly dries out and becomes 
cool again. Summer clothes made of linen possess high air permeability, which allows air to flow 
through the fabric easily and allows the body to breathe.

Next, to coolness and high absorbency, linen has one more very favorable property – good heat 
conductivity characteristics. Heat conductivity refers to the extent to which heat can be 
conveyed through the fabric. As linen quickly allows the heat to escape, it further improves 
cooling. It is claimed, that heat conductivity of linen is five times higher than wool and 
eighteen times higher than silk. One more thing – linen weave reflects heat better, too. This 
means linen blouse, linen dress or shirt has good “shading” properties as well and again – 
the wearer of linen clothing feels cooler.

## Physical properties of Flax/Linen fibers
* Colour – yellowish to gray
* Length – 18 to 30 inches
* Tensile strength – tenacity of 5.5 to 6.5 gms/den.
* Elongation at a break – 2.7 to 3.5 %
* Elastic recovery – not enough
* Specific gravity – 1.54
* Moisture regain – 10 to 12%
* Effect of heat – excellent resistance, a good conductor of heat
* Effect of sunlight – not affected
* Resiliency – very poor
* Lusture – brighter than cotton, slightly silky
* Abrasion resistance – moderate

## Chemical properties of Flax/Linen Fibers
* Bleaching action: Flax (Linen) is made difficult to bleach than cotton, its huge amount of impurities, like pectin and gum.
* Effect of Acids: Flax not affected by weak acids but is damaged by concentrated acids.
* Effect of alkali: Flax has good resistance to alkaline solutions
* Effect of organic solvents: high Resistant
* Effect of insects: Flax is not attacked by moth, grubs or beetles.
* Effect of micro-orgasms: Attacked by fungi and bacteria, mild dew feed on linen fabrics
* Dyeability: Not good affinity to dyes. Direct and vat dyes are suitable for flax fiber.

## Characteristics of Flax/Linen Fiber/Fabrics
* Clothes that made of linen is comfortable to Use: As the Linen fiber is a natural vegetable fiber it has a huge amount of Air Porosity holes. So, the air can go in and out while wearing these linen clothes and which make these clothes quite comfortable.
* Linen Fiber is stronger than Cotton: Another reason behind of the linen fiber popularity is – you will get the same comfort like Cotton in the Linen fiber but the strength of the Linen fiber is twice than the Cotton fiber. Maximum sportswear where the strength is a matter, there the Linen fiber made linen clothes is widely used.
* Hand Washable & Dry Cleanable: You can not only wash the clothes linen but also clean the lien clothes by drying. So, making linen clothes by using the linen fiber is a wise decision for the Textile Industry owner.
* Crisp feeling: If you touch the linen fiber, you will feel that it’s a simply crisp fiber which has distinctive outlook and feels.
* Tailors Well: One textile weavers or textile knitter can easily make the Linen fabric by using the flexible linen fiber and the tailors of the Garment Shop, even can easily make Dress and suits by using the Linen fabrics.
* Absorbent: The absorbency of Linen fiber is quite good and this is why linen can be dyed well.
* Dyes & Prints well: Along with the optimum efficiency in Dyeing, one can easily print the Linen cloth except for any kind of problems like print paste saturation, discolored surface etc.
* Lightweight To Heavyweight: Any kind of linen fabric or linen fibers are available on the market which can be achieved in any weight as per the Textile buyers’ requirement.
* No Static & Pilling problems: If any fabric produces the static electricity during wear, then nothing can be worst than that. People like to wear the fabric that is flexible and comfortable to wear. Linen is the perfect fabric in this regard which has no static electricity and pilling problems.
* Good Abrasion Resistant: As the linen fiber is good in strength, then it is supposed to have the properties like Good abrasion resistant

# [Felt](http://www.madehow.com/Volume-7/Felt.html)

Felt may be the oldest fabric known to man, and there are many references to felt in ancient writings Since felt is not woven and does not require a loom for its production, ancient man made it rather easily. Some of the earliest felt remains were found in the frozen tombs of nomadic horsemen in the Siberian Tlai mountains and date to around 700 B.C. These tribes made clothing, saddles, and tents from felt because it was strong and resistant to wet and snowy weather. Legend has it that during the Middle Ages St. Clement, who was to become the fourth bishop of Rome, was a wandering monk who happened upon the process of making felt by accident. It is said he stuffed his sandals with tow (short flax or linen fibers) in order to make them more comfortable. St. Clement discovered that the combination of moisture from perspiration and ground dampness coupled with pressure from his feet matted these tow fibers together and produced a cloth. After becoming bishop he set up groups of workers to develop felting operations. St. Clement became the patron saint for hatmakers, who extensively utilize felt to this day.


## [Ancient Felt in Turkey and China](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1525/aa.1930.32.1.02a00020)
The Hiung-nu, a Turkish tribe, subsisted on cattle, fed upon
flesh and milk, and used leather obtained from the skins of their domestic
animals as clothing and armor; in addition to leather garments they wore
coats or overcoats of felt and lived in tents covered with the same material.
It is very probable that the Chinese made their first acquaintance with felt
during their long military and diplomatic intercourse with the Hiung-nu
which lasted for many centuries. In 307 B.C. Wu-ling, king of the principality Chao, adopted the clothing and the tactics of shooting with the bow
on horseback from the nomadic tribes. Chinese garments were spacious,
loose, and flowing,and aserious obstacle to riding and shooting,while the costume of the nomads was tight-fitting and equipped with tall boots. There
is no doubt that on the occasion of this reform movement in dress also articles of felt and perhaps the manufacture of felt itself were adopted by the
Chinese. The country inhabited by the nomads is known to them under the
name “the land of felt.” 


In central Tibet all men, even the Dalai Lama, wear a high-crowned, redfringed felt hat; the women wear a red felt hat in the summer. The felt
made by them is praised by a Chinese author of the eighteenth century; it is
also worked up, he adds, into boots. In fact, the women of Tibet mostly
wear high felt boots. These are of the same shape as the leather boots usually worn by men and reaching up to the knees. These felt boots are trimmed
with colored patches, the lower part white, then red and green. Like the
leather boots they are lined with woolen cloth, while the soles are always of 
8 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 32, 1930
leather. The Tibetan boot is devoid of a heel. The Tibetan nomads wear
high conical felt hats with a large brim turned downward. 

...
The Medes also availed themselves of bags and sacks made of felt,
and the Persians used felt for the trappings of their horses. 

...
Of felt pieces and fragments discovered by Sir Aurel Stein in Chinese
Turkestan may particularly be mentioned a felt pad of kidney shape covered with buff silk, a conical headgear in carefully gored yellow felt shaped
like a Phrygian cap, shoe-soles, a fragment with a wave-scroll pattern in
thin crimson felt sewed on; fragments of felt dyed yellow, red, and scarlet;
small pieces of yellow felt painted on a tempera surface with floral and
geometrical designs in a variety of colors, and many others. With reference
to his discovery of crimson felt it may not be amiss to call to mind the purple or scarlet felt used for draping the funeral pile of Hephaestion when
this friend of Alexander the Great died at Ecbatana in 324 B.C. and was
interred at Babylon with splendid obsequies by order of his master. 

...
In the ruined fort of Miran he found a well-preserved felt pouch which
might have formed part of a soldier’s equipment (plate 138, fig. 27). Kokyar is also renowned for its felt socks called paipak, and Karghalik is the
great market for them.

Another archaeological discovery of importance was made two generations ago by W. Radloff in graves of southern Siberia which belong to the
Iron age. From these he brought to light a felt boot or sock, the sole of
which was wrought from a very fine kind of felt. This was the product of
some ancient Turkish tribe. Pointed caps appear frequently on stone monuments or on bronze plaques of southern Siberia, and these were doubtless
made of felt. 

...
The ancients used chiefly sheep wool for making felt, more rarely the
hair of goat, camel, hare, and beaver. It seems that felt was sometimes
used to cover the bodies of animals. According to Aristotle, the Greeks
clothed their sheep with soft wool either with skins or with pieces of felt, and
the wool turned gray in consequence. 

...
Boots and socks were likewise made of felt, and there is an instance on
record that **it was used in lieu of armor by Caesar’s soldiers when they were
much annoyed by Pompey’s archers** and in need of arrow-proof jerkins
(Bellurn civile III,44). Thucydides refers to a similar expedient to protect
the body from arrows. Even in besieging and defending cities felt was used,
together with hides and sackcloth, to cover the wooden towers and military
engines. 

Papadopoulo-Vretos, in 1845, made this communication to the
Academy of Inscriptions and Letters of Paris:
I have macerated unbleached flax in vinegar saturated with salt, and after compression have obtained a felt, with a power of resistance quite comparable with that
of the famous armor of Conrad of Montferrat; seeing that **neither the point of a
sword, nor even balls discharged from fire-arms, were able to penetrate it.**
The felting process was denoted by the verb cogere (“to bring together,
to pile up”). A felter was called a coactor, coactiliarius, or coactor lanarius
(“wool felter”) ; his art was designated ars coactiliaria; felt products were
styled coacta. In an edict of the Emperor Diocletianus (A.D. 285-305)
is mentioned a horse-cover of felt under the term centunclum equestre
coactile.

# [Gabeson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambeson)
A gambeson (also aketon, padded jack or arming doublet) is a padded defensive jacket, worn as armor separately, or combined with mail or plate armor. Gambesons were produced with a sewing technique called quilting. They were usually constructed of linen or wool; the stuffing varied, and could be for example scrap cloth or horse hair. During the 14th century, illustrations usually show buttons or laces up the front.

An arming doublet (also called aketon) worn under armor, particularly plate armor of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Europe, contains arming points for attaching plates. Fifteenth century examples may include goussets sewn into the elbows and armpits to protect the wearer in locations not covered by plate. German gothic armor arming doublets were generally shorter than Italian white armor doublets, which could extend to the upper thigh. In late fifteenth century Italy this also became a civilian fashion. Men who were not knights wore arming doublets, probably because the garment suggested status and chivalry.[1]

Quilted leather open jackets and trousers were worn by Scythian horsemen before the 4th century BC, as can be seen on Scythian gold ornaments crafted by Greek goldsmiths. The European gambeson can be traced at least to the late 10th century, but it is likely to have been in use in various forms for longer than that. In Europe, its use became widespread in the 13th century, and peaked in the 14th and 15th centuries.

The gambeson was used both as a complete armor unto itself and underneath mail and plate in order to cushion the body and prevent chafing. It was very insulating and thus uncomfortable, but its protection was vital for the soldier.

There are two distinctive designs of gambeson: those designed to be worn beneath another armor, and those designed to be worn as independent armor. The latter tend to be thicker and higher in the collar, and faced with other materials, such as leather, or heavy canvas. This variant is usually referred to as padded jack and made of several (some say around 18,[7] some even 30[8]) layers of cotton, linen or wool. These jacks were known to stop even heavy arrows[8] and their design of multiple layers bears a striking resemblance to modern day body armor, which substituted at first silk, ballistic nylon and later Kevlar as fabric.


# [Lamellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamellar_armour)

* [Klivanion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klivanion)


Lamellar armour is a type of body armour, made from small rectangular plates (scales or lamellae) of iron or steel, leather (rawhide), or bronze laced into horizontal rows. Lamellar armor was used over a wide range of time periods in Central Asia, Eastern Asia (especially in China, Japan, Mongolia, and Tibet), Western Asia, and Eastern Europe. The earliest evidence for lamellar armor comes from sculpted artwork of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the Near East.

Lamellar armour consists of small platelets known as "lamellae" or "lames", which are punched and laced together, typically in horizontal rows. Lamellae can be made of metal, leather cuir bouilli, horn, stone, bone or more exotic substances. Metal lamellae may be lacquered to resist corrosion or for decoration. Unlike scale armour, which it resembles, lamellar armour is not attached to a cloth or leather backing (although it is typically worn over a padded undergarment).

In Asia, lamellar armor eventually overtook scale armour in popularity as lamellar restricted the user's movements much less than scale armour.[1]

# [Cuirass or Breastplate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuirass)

A cuirass (/kwɪˈræs, kjʊəˈræs/;[1] French: cuirasse, Latin: coriaceus) is a piece of armor that is formed of a single or multiple pieces of metal or other rigid material which covers the torso. The use of the term "cuirass" generally refers to both the chest plate (or breastplate) and the back piece together. Whereas a chest plate only protects the front and a back plate only protects the back, a cuirass protects both the front and the back.


# [Jack of Plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_of_plate)

A jack of plate is a type of armour made up of small iron plates sewn between layers of felt and canvas. They were commonly referred to simply as a "jack" (although this could also refer to any outer garment). This type of armour was used by common Medieval European soldiers as well as by the rebel peasants known as Jacquerie.[1] The present day equivalent is perhaps a bullet-proof vest.[2]


Making a reproduction jack of plate
The jack is similar to the brigandine. The main difference is in the method of construction: a brigandine is riveted whereas a jack is sewn. Jacks of plate were created by stitching as many as 1000 small overlapping squares of iron between two canvases.[3] The garments weighed about 17 pounds (7.7 kg), which made them much more acceptable to the wearer than solid breastplates. They also offered a tactical advantage: they allowed soldiers to rest the butts of weapons firmly against their shoulders, which wasn't feasible with smooth-surfaced plate armours. Jacks were often made from recycled pieces of older plate armor, including damaged brigandines and cuirasses cut into small squares.[4]

# [Mirror or Disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_armour)

Mirror armour (Russian: зерцало, zertsalo, meaning "mirror"; Chinese: 护心镜, hùxīnjìng, meaning "protect-heart mirror"), sometimes referred to as disc armour or as chahār-āyneh or char-aina (Persian: چهاﺮآﻳنه‎ meaning "four mirrors"; whence Kazakh: шар-айна, şar-ayna), was a type of cuirass used mainly in Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe; including Indian, Persia, Tibet, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire. It literally translates to "four mirrors" which is a reflection of how these pieces looked, which resembles four (sometimes more) metal discs or rectangular armour plates. Mirror armor was used in some cultures up to the 20th century.

"Mirror armour" is a type of partial plate armour which was developed initially from round metal mirrors (a kind of rondel) worn over other armour (usually over mail) as enforcement. Metal mirrors in this armour were considered as protection from not only cold steel and arrows, but also supernatural influence. It was believed that mirrors could reflect the evil eye, so they were polished and worn over other armour.

Early mirror armour consisted of a round mirror attached to the body with a few leather laces (similar to the Roman phaelerae). In Europe, they were known as kardiophylax (Greek) or apezak (Armenian) and were popular with various Bronze Age civilisations, as well as the Central Asian tribes such as the Saka and Yuezhi, and also among the Sasanians.

Late mirror armour took the form of a mirror cuirass, helmet, greaves, and bracers worn with mail. There were two alternative constructions of mirror cuirass:

with discs – two large round mirrors surrounded by smaller mirror plates, such as the Klivanion.
without discs – typically having four mirror plates – frontplate, backplate, and two sideplates joined by hinges or laces.
Early types of this armour were known among the Celtiberians,[1] by the Romans, in the Middle East, Central Asia, India, Russia, Siberia (where it was worn by Siberian natives before the Russian conquest), Mongolia, Indochina and China (including Tibet too).

Later types of this armour were known in the Middle East, Central Asia, India, and Russia. The mirror cuirass with discs was popular in Turkey and Russia, while that without discs was popular in Persia, Central Asia and India.

In India, there was a popular form of brigandine with a few mirror plates riveted to it.


# [Brigandine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigandine)

A brigandine is a form of body armour from the Middle Ages. It is a garment typically made of heavy cloth, canvas or leather, lined internally with small oblong steel plates riveted to the fabric, sometimes with a second layer of fabric on the inside.

# [Coat of Plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_plates)

A coat of plates is a form of segmented torso armour consisting of overlapping metal plates riveted inside a cloth or leather garment. The coat of plates is considered part of the era of transitional armour and was normally worn as part of a full knightly harness. The coat saw its introduction in Europe among the warring elite in the 1180s or 1220s and was well established by the 1250s.[1] It was in very common usage by the 1290s.[2] By the 1350s it was universal among infantry militias as well.[1] After about 1340, the plates covering the chest were combined to form an early breastplate, replacing the coat of plates.[3] After 1370, the breastplate covered the entire torso.[3] Different forms of the coat of plates, known as the brigandine and jack of plates, remained in use until the late 16th century.[2]

# [Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_armour)

Scale armour (or scale mail) is an early form of armour consisting of many individual small armour scales (plates) of various shapes attached to each other and to a backing of cloth or leather in overlapping rows.[1] Scale armour was worn by warriors of many different cultures as well as their horses. The material used to make the **scales varied and included bronze, iron, steel, rawhide, leather, cuir bouilli, seeds, horn, or [pangolin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangolin) scales**. The variations are primarily the result of material availability.

Scale armour – a defence of very great antiquity – began in the Middle East. The earliest representation is the tomb of Kenamon, who lived in Egypt in the reign of Amenhotep II (1436–1411 BCE).[2]

# [Cuir Bouilli or Boiled Leather/Hardened Leather/Moulded Leather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiled_leather)

Boiled leather, often referred to by its French translation, cuir bouilli (French: [kɥiʁ buji]), was a historical material for various uses common in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period. It was leather that had been treated so that it became tough and rigid, as well as able to hold moulded decoration. It was the usual material for the robust carrying-cases that were made for important pieces of metalwork, instruments such as astrolabes, personal sets of cutlery, books, pens and the like.[1] It was used for some armour, being both much cheaper and much lighter than plate armour, but could not withstand a direct blow from a blade, nor a gunshot.[2]
