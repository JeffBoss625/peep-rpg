# Hoplite (Ancient Greece)

avg height human today: 170 cm (male), 158 cm (female)
avg height 162 cm (male), 153 cm (female)
avg weigth 63 kg (male), 53 kg (female)

The principal weapons of a hoplite infantryman were a long ash wood spear (doru) and a short sword (xiphos).
The spear measured on average 2.5 metres (8 ft.) in length and was fitted with a bronze or iron blade and
a four-sided end spike (sauroter). The sword was also of iron with a straight or sometimes curved blade
(machaira or kopis) no more than 60 cm (2 ft) in length. No doubt many hoplites also carried a dagger (encheiridion)
as extra insurance. Protection was provided by a leather-lined bronze helmet which could vary in design, was
often crested, and protected the head, neck, and face. A corselet or breastplate (thorax) of bronze or
leather (later reduced to a laminated linen vest to save weight - a linothorax), bronze greaves (knemides)
to protect the shins, and sometimes arm-guards were also worn.
The hoplite carried a large circular shield (hoplon or aspis) some 80 cm (2.5 ft.) in diameter and weighing
as much as 8 kg. This was made of wood or stiff leather, faced with bronze, and was held with the left arm
placed through a central band (porpax) and gripped via a strap (antilabe) attached to the shield rim.

# A few words about bronze from discussion: 
http://myarmoury.com/talk/viewtopic.31591.html:
...Iron is harder than soft bronzes, but hard high tin bronzes (such as were used to make cutting weapons)
are harder than iron. Work-hardened iron can be harder than annealed high tin bronzes, but
work-hardened high tin bronzes are harder still.

For bronze vs iron weapons, bronze will be harder. But bronze weapons need to be a little thicker
to have the same stiffness, since bronze has a lower elastic modulus, and bronze is denser, so bronze
weapons will be heavier, on average, for the same length and similar geometry.

High-tin bronze that is hammer-hardened is *harder* than any iron or steel available in the ancient world.
It isn't until quenching of high-carbon steels becomes common that steel is overall superior to bronze.
Mind you, straight hardness is only one of many qualities that must be compared when considering
what makes weapons or armor "better"!

##Combat techniques

Analysis of battle damage to weapons from the massive Roman Iron Age deposit of Nydham indicated 
the primary use for the large round shields was in fending off missiles, while sword duels were 
conducted blade on blade (Schloß Gottorf: Archäologische Landesmuseum der Christian-Albrechts 
Universität, Schleswig Germany: pers. obs. 1994). However, the use of shields in hand to hand 
combat is recorded in customs such as the holmgang duel. The heavy iron construction of the Viking 
Age boss is unlike the Roman Iron Age examples of thin bronze, perhaps indicating a change to a 
hand-to-hand fighting style in which parrys with the boss were possible. The thin boards would 
split easily, and could perhaps have been deliberately made so, in order to snare an attacker's 
blade.

* [Thickness Measures](shield-thickness.jpg)


Small clamps made of iron or bronze sheet are occasionally found in graves (Table 3; Fig. 5). 
Clamps were sometimes simply decorated by tinning, punching or engraving (Fig. 5-c). In Birka graves Bj 
628 and 736 the clamps were butted to produce a continuous edge (Fig. 6), however, only sections of 
the rim survive, perhaps indicating deliberate damage before burial.

# [Flax](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/flax-fiber#:~:text=Flax%20is%20stronger%20than%20cotton,from%20flax%20is%20called%20linen.)

Flax fibre comes under the category of bast fibre (Fig. 3.1) and is extracted from the plant of the 
linseed/flax plant (Linum usitatissimum L.). This plant is popular for two reason: one is flax fibre 
and another is linseed oil (used for industrial applications) extracted from the seed of the plant 
(Basu and Dutta, 2014). According to historical records, the earliest example of preserved linen 
appears to be a needle-netted linen headpiece from Nahal Hemar Cave in Israel 8500 years ago, and 
Swiss Lake Dwellers used a native flax to make cloth 5000–6000 years ago. It was also found that 
ancient Egyptians used clothing, bed linen, and shrouds for mummies and for ships’ sails prepared 
mainly from linen in those days. The earliest Egyptian linen cloth dates from the Old Kingdom, but 
flax appears to be have been grown for linen about 5000 years ago in the Early Dynastic period 
(Debnath, 2016). Sharma et al. (1999) described and compared different retting methods of flax 
fibre, including water, dew and enzyme-retted, on physical chemical and thermal properties of flax
fibre. 

Linen is a “stiff” fabric and is less likely to cling to the skin; when it billows away, it quickly 
dries out and becomes cool again. Summer clothes made of linen possess high air permeability, 
which allows air to flow through the fabric easily and allows the body to breathe.

The main benefit of wearing linen clothes in hot weather is the coolness they provide. Thanks 
to the weave and linen fiber specifics linen fabric allow more airflow and its structure means 
it stays away from your skin allowing better airflow over your body. Linen is a “stiff” fabric 
and is less likely to cling to the skin; when it billows away, it quickly dries out and becomes 
cool again. Summer clothes made of linen possess high air permeability, which allows air to flow 
through the fabric easily and allows the body to breathe.

Next, to coolness and high absorbency, linen has one more very favorable property – good heat 
conductivity characteristics. Heat conductivity refers to the extent to which heat can be 
conveyed through the fabric. As linen quickly allows the heat to escape, it further improves 
cooling. It is claimed, that heat conductivity of linen is five times higher than wool and 
eighteen times higher than silk. One more thing – linen weave reflects heat better, too. This 
means linen blouse, linen dress or shirt has good “shading” properties as well and again – 
the wearer of linen clothing feels cooler.

## Physical properties of Flax/Linen fibers
* Colour – yellowish to gray
* Length – 18 to 30 inches
* Tensile strength – tenacity of 5.5 to 6.5 gms/den.
* Elongation at a break – 2.7 to 3.5 %
* Elastic recovery – not enough
* Specific gravity – 1.54
* Moisture regain – 10 to 12%
* Effect of heat – excellent resistance, a good conductor of heat
* Effect of sunlight – not affected
* Resiliency – very poor
* Lusture – brighter than cotton, slightly silky
* Abrasion resistance – moderate

## Chemical properties of Flax/Linen Fibers
* Bleaching action: Flax (Linen) is made difficult to bleach than cotton, its huge amount of impurities, like pectin and gum.
* Effect of Acids: Flax not affected by weak acids but is damaged by concentrated acids.
* Effect of alkali: Flax has good resistance to alkaline solutions
* Effect of organic solvents: high Resistant
* Effect of insects: Flax is not attacked by moth, grubs or beetles.
* Effect of micro-orgasms: Attacked by fungi and bacteria, mild dew feed on linen fabrics
* Dyeability: Not good affinity to dyes. Direct and vat dyes are suitable for flax fiber.

## Characteristics of Flax/Linen Fiber/Fabrics
* Clothes that made of linen is comfortable to Use: As the Linen fiber is a natural vegetable fiber it has a huge amount of Air Porosity holes. So, the air can go in and out while wearing these linen clothes and which make these clothes quite comfortable.
* Linen Fiber is stronger than Cotton: Another reason behind of the linen fiber popularity is – you will get the same comfort like Cotton in the Linen fiber but the strength of the Linen fiber is twice than the Cotton fiber. Maximum sportswear where the strength is a matter, there the Linen fiber made linen clothes is widely used.
* Hand Washable & Dry Cleanable: You can not only wash the clothes linen but also clean the lien clothes by drying. So, making linen clothes by using the linen fiber is a wise decision for the Textile Industry owner.
* Crisp feeling: If you touch the linen fiber, you will feel that it’s a simply crisp fiber which has distinctive outlook and feels.
* Tailors Well: One textile weavers or textile knitter can easily make the Linen fabric by using the flexible linen fiber and the tailors of the Garment Shop, even can easily make Dress and suits by using the Linen fabrics.
* Absorbent: The absorbency of Linen fiber is quite good and this is why linen can be dyed well.
* Dyes & Prints well: Along with the optimum efficiency in Dyeing, one can easily print the Linen cloth except for any kind of problems like print paste saturation, discolored surface etc.
* Lightweight To Heavyweight: Any kind of linen fabric or linen fibers are available on the market which can be achieved in any weight as per the Textile buyers’ requirement.
* No Static & Pilling problems: If any fabric produces the static electricity during wear, then nothing can be worst than that. People like to wear the fabric that is flexible and comfortable to wear. Linen is the perfect fabric in this regard which has no static electricity and pilling problems.
* Good Abrasion Resistant: As the linen fiber is good in strength, then it is supposed to have the properties like Good abrasion resistant

# [Felt](http://www.madehow.com/Volume-7/Felt.html)

Felt may be the oldest fabric known to man, and there are many references to felt in ancient writings Since felt is not woven and does not require a loom for its production, ancient man made it rather easily. Some of the earliest felt remains were found in the frozen tombs of nomadic horsemen in the Siberian Tlai mountains and date to around 700 B.C. These tribes made clothing, saddles, and tents from felt because it was strong and resistant to wet and snowy weather. Legend has it that during the Middle Ages St. Clement, who was to become the fourth bishop of Rome, was a wandering monk who happened upon the process of making felt by accident. It is said he stuffed his sandals with tow (short flax or linen fibers) in order to make them more comfortable. St. Clement discovered that the combination of moisture from perspiration and ground dampness coupled with pressure from his feet matted these tow fibers together and produced a cloth. After becoming bishop he set up groups of workers to develop felting operations. St. Clement became the patron saint for hatmakers, who extensively utilize felt to this day.
