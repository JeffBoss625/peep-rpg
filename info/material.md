# Hoplite (Ancient Greece)

avg height human today: 170 cm (male), 158 cm (female)
avg height 162 cm (male), 153 cm (female)
avg weigth 63 kg (male), 53 kg (female)

The principal weapons of a hoplite infantryman were a long ash wood spear (doru) and a short sword (xiphos).
The spear measured on average 2.5 metres (8 ft.) in length and was fitted with a bronze or iron blade and
a four-sided end spike (sauroter). The sword was also of iron with a straight or sometimes curved blade
(machaira or kopis) no more than 60 cm (2 ft) in length. No doubt many hoplites also carried a dagger (encheiridion)
as extra insurance. Protection was provided by a leather-lined bronze helmet which could vary in design, was
often crested, and protected the head, neck, and face. A corselet or breastplate (thorax) of bronze or
leather (later reduced to a laminated linen vest to save weight - a linothorax), bronze greaves (knemides)
to protect the shins, and sometimes arm-guards were also worn.
The hoplite carried a large circular shield (hoplon or aspis) some 80 cm (2.5 ft.) in diameter and weighing
as much as 8 kg. This was made of wood or stiff leather, faced with bronze, and was held with the left arm
placed through a central band (porpax) and gripped via a strap (antilabe) attached to the shield rim.

# A few words about bronze from discussion: 
http://myarmoury.com/talk/viewtopic.31591.html:
...Iron is harder than soft bronzes, but hard high tin bronzes (such as were used to make cutting weapons)
are harder than iron. Work-hardened iron can be harder than annealed high tin bronzes, but
work-hardened high tin bronzes are harder still.

For bronze vs iron weapons, bronze will be harder. But bronze weapons need to be a little thicker
to have the same stiffness, since bronze has a lower elastic modulus, and bronze is denser, so bronze
weapons will be heavier, on average, for the same length and similar geometry.

High-tin bronze that is hammer-hardened is *harder* than any iron or steel available in the ancient world.
It isn't until quenching of high-carbon steels becomes common that steel is overall superior to bronze.
Mind you, straight hardness is only one of many qualities that must be compared when considering
what makes weapons or armor "better"!

##Combat techniques

Analysis of battle damage to weapons from the massive Roman Iron Age deposit of Nydham indicated 
the primary use for the large round shields was in fending off missiles, while sword duels were 
conducted blade on blade (Schloß Gottorf: Archäologische Landesmuseum der Christian-Albrechts 
Universität, Schleswig Germany: pers. obs. 1994). However, the use of shields in hand to hand 
combat is recorded in customs such as the holmgang duel. The heavy iron construction of the Viking 
Age boss is unlike the Roman Iron Age examples of thin bronze, perhaps indicating a change to a 
hand-to-hand fighting style in which parrys with the boss were possible. The thin boards would 
split easily, and could perhaps have been deliberately made so, in order to snare an attacker's 
blade.

* [Thickness Measures](shield-thickness.jpg)


Small clamps made of iron or bronze sheet are occasionally found in graves (Table 3; Fig. 5). 
Clamps were sometimes simply decorated by tinning, punching or engraving (Fig. 5-c). In Birka graves Bj 
628 and 736 the clamps were butted to produce a continuous edge (Fig. 6), however, only sections of 
the rim survive, perhaps indicating deliberate damage before burial.
